## Yolov8 Image Clasiffication
The YOLOv8 image classification model is designed to detect 1000 pre-defined classes in images in real-time. Image classification is the simplest of the three tasks and involves classifying an entire image into one of a set of predefined classes.
Here I have uesd "yolov8s-cls.pt" model on my custom dataset.

## CNN + Random Forest for Image Clasiffication
CNNs are designed to extract the essential features of any image dataset automatically. Therefore, using CNNs predictions as features enhances the generalizability of the proposed method. By using an ensemble of random forest, our method was able to achieve high classification accuracy.
